    <h1>Django, framework web</h1>
    <p>
        Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written
         in Python that promotes rapid development and clean, 
         pragmatic design. Created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and 
         Simon Willison at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, 
         Django was publicly released under a BSD license in July 2005. 
         The framework, named after jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, 
         emphasizes reusability, less code, and the "Don't Repeat 
         Yourself" (DRY) principle. It includes features like an ORM
         (Object-Relational Mapping), an admin interface, built-in
         security measures, scalability, a templating system,
         form handling, URL routing, and internationalization support. Key
         milestones in its development include the release
         of version 1.0 in 2008, the introduction of long-term
         support (LTS) versions such as 1.8, 1.11, 2.2,
         and 3.2, and the evolution through the 2.x
         and 3.x series, which brought incremental improvements
         and new features. Django's "batteries-included"
         philosophy ensures it comes with numerous built-in
         tools, reducing the need for third-party plugins
         and facilitating the creation of robust web
         applications efficiently.
